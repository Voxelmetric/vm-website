# vm-website

The Voxelmetric uses [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) to build its static web site available at http://voxelmetric.net/. This site is meant to be a collection of info and documentation for Voxelmetric. The page content is found in the content folder, all in markdown. The site theme is stored in theme and it's based on mkdocks bootstrap. Feel free to contribute!
